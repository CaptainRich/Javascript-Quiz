## Project Objective
As a coding boot camp student, I want to take  timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals so that I can guage my progress compared to my peers.  The quiz utility should store high scores in the browser's local storage.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given I am taking a (JavaScript) code quiz:

1) WHEN I click the start button, THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
2) WHEN I answer a question, THEN I am presented with another question.
3) WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, THEN time is subtracted from the clock.
4) WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, THEN the game is over.
5) WHEN the game is over, THEN I can save my initials and score.
